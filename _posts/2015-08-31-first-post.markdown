First post, hehe.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight http %}
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx
Date: Thu, 20 Aug 2015 16:55:48 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive Content-Encoding: gzip
!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>JetBrains</title>
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
